</div><!--header-->
<div class="contents">
<div class="textblock"><p>Here is a list of coding rules that are enforced by the plumedcheck script. These rules are necessary to be sure that the codebase is consistent. Code not satisfying these rules will make the automatic test on travis-ci fail. In the following we provide a list of errors that are detected automatically, together with a short explanation of the reason we consider these as errors. The names used are the same ones reported by plumedcheck. The <code>plumedcheck</code> script can be used as is, but the simplest way to obtain a report is to go to the <code>buildroot/src</code> directory and type <code>make plumedcheck</code>. In case you think you have a valid reason for a code not passing the check to be merged, please contact the developers.</p>
<p><em>wrong_module_type</em></p>
<p>Module type as indicated in the <code>module.type</code> file located in the module directory is not valid. The admitted types are: <code>default-on</code>, which means the module is on by default, <code>default-off</code>, which means that they should be explicitly enabled, and <code>always</code>, which means they are always required.</p>
<p><em>used_wrapper_module</em></p>
<p>Wrapper module should not be used in other modules (via <code>USE=wrapper</code> in <code>Makefile</code>). The reason is that this makes <code>libplumedKernel</code> dependent on the PLUMED wrappers. An exception is the <code>main</code> module, which needs to use the <code>wrapper</code> module. Notice that within the PLUMED library there is no need to use the external <code>cmd</code> interface since one can directly declare a <code>PlumedMain</code> object.</p>
<p><em>astyle</em></p>
<p>In order to keep the code readable, we use the astyle program to format all source files. This error indicates that the reported file has not been formatted correctly. It is important that the version of astyle and the options exactly match the ones we use for testing. To this aim, you should use a command such as <code>make astyle</code> from the plumed root directory.</p>
<p><em>autoconf</em></p>
<p>In our git repository we distribute both <code>./configure</code> and <code>./configure.ac</code> files. When you modify the latter, the former should be regenerated using <code>autoconf</code> and committed to git. This error indicates that the <code>./configure.ac</code> and <code>./configure</code> files in the repository are not consistent. Notice that this test should be performed using exactly the same autoconf version that was used to generate the <code>./configure</code> file.</p>
<p><em>include_dots</em></p>
<p>It is considered an error to include a file using a path starting with <code>../dir</code>, where <code>dir</code> is not the name of a module explicitly declared as used in the Makefile. This might result in undetected dependences between the modules, which means that by enabling some set of modules one would result in a non-linkable library. As an exception, one can include files such as <code>../dir</code> where <code>dir</code> is the current module since this would obviously create no problem. This would simplify life when moving files from a directory to another.</p>
<p><em>deprecated_headers</em></p>
<p>There is a list of headers that have been deprecated in C++ and should not be included. These headers should be replaced with their equivalent from the stdlib. E.g., use <code>#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;</code> instead of <code>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</code>. Notice that using the modern header all the functions are declared inside the <code>std</code> namespace. Also notice that we have a special exception to allow them in Plumed.h.</p>
<p><em>external_header</em> (style)</p>
<p>Header files should possibly not include other header files from external libraries. Indeed, once PLUMED is installed, if paths are not set correctly the include files of the other libraries might not be reachable anymore. This is only a stylistic warning now. Notice that with the current implementation of class Communicator it is necessary to include <code>mpi.h</code> in a header file.</p>
<p><em>non_h_header</em></p>
<p>Files with <code>.inc</code> extension are generated by PLUMED while it is compiled and are not installed. They should not be directly included in header files, otherwise those header files could be not usable once PLUMED is installed.</p>
<p><em>include_non_used_module</em></p>
<p>When including a file in the form <code>"dir/file.h"</code>, <code>dir</code> should be an used module. This makes sure that we do not include system files that by chance are named as PLUMED modules. Indeed, when including <code>"file"</code> if the file is not found in the current path it is searched in system directories.</p>
<p><em>multi_registered_action</em></p>
<p>Each action should be registered (with <code>PLUMED_REGISTER_ACTION</code>) once and only once.</p>
<p><em>multi_registered_cltool</em></p>
<p>Each cltool should be registered (with <code>PLUMED_REGISTER_CLTOOL</code>) once and only once.</p>
<p><em>multi_registered_vessel</em></p>
<p>Each vessel should be registered (with <code>PLUMED_REGISTER_VESSEL</code>) once and only once.</p>
<p><em>multi_registered_metric</em></p>
<p>Each metric should be registered (with <code>PLUMED_REGISTER_METRIC</code>) once and only once.</p>
<p><em>multi_doc</em></p>
<p>An action or cltool should be documented once and only once. Notice that because of the way the manual is generated, a cltool cannot have the same name of an action.</p>
<p><em>using_namespace_in_header</em></p>
<p>A statement <code>using namespace</code> in header files is considered bad practice. Indeed, this would imply that any other file including that header file would be using the same namespace. This is true also for <code>std</code> namespace, and that's why you typically find full specifications such as <code>std::string</code> in header files.</p>
<p><em>using_namespace_std_in_source</em></p>
<p>A statement <code>using namespace std</code> in a source files is considered bad practice. Indeed, it makes it difficult to distinguish classes and functions that are taken from the standard library (such as <code>std::vector</code>) from similar names declared locally. This is currently a style issue, but will become an error in the future.</p>
<p><em>using_namespace_std_in_default_source</em></p>
<p>A statement <code>using namespace std</code> in a source files is considered bad practice. Indeed, it makes it difficult to distinguish classes and functions that are taken from the standard library (such as <code>std::vector</code>) from similar names declared locally. This is currently an error for default modules.</p>
<p><em>used_has_in_header</em> (style)</p>
<p>Using <code>__PLUMED_HAS_SOMETHING</code> macros in headers should be avoided since it could make it difficult to make sure the same macros are correctly defined when using PLUMED as a library. This is only a stylistic warning now. Notice that with the current implementation of class Communicator it is necessary to include <code>mpi.h</code> in a header file and thus to use <code>__PLUMED_HAS_MPI</code>.</p>
<p><em>missing_namespace_plmd</em></p>
<p>Every source file should contain a <code><a class="el" href="namespace_p_l_m_d.html">PLMD</a></code> namespace. Notice that files in the "outer  modules" <code>wrapper</code> and <code>main</code>, that is those that are not included in the kernel library, are exempted from this rule.</p>
<p><em>missing_namespace_module</em></p>
<p>Every source file should contain a sub namespace with the same name of the module itself. Notice that there are important exceptions to this rule:</p><ul>
<li>"outer modules" <code>wrapper</code> and <code>main</code>, that are not included in the kernel library.</li>
<li>"core modules" that are part of the core of PLUMED. Since the classes implemented here are widely used within PLUMED, they are directly defined in the <a class="el" href="namespace_p_l_m_d.html">PLMD</a> namespace.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>missing_guard</em></p>
<p>Every header file should contain a proper guard to avoid double inclusion. The format of the guard is fixed and should be <code>__PLUMED_modulename_filename_h</code>, where <code>modulename</code> is the name of the module and <code>filename</code> is the name of the file, without suffix. This choice makes guards unique within the whole codebase.</p>
<p><em>non_existing_cpp</em></p>
<p>For every header file there should exist a corresponding source file with the same name. Notice that dummy headers that only include another header or which only define preprocessor macros are exempted from this rule.</p>
<p><em>non_included_h</em></p>
<p>The source file corresponding to a header file (that is: with the same name) should include it as the first included file. This is to make sure that all the header files that we install can be individually included and compiled.</p>
<p><em>undocumented_action</em></p>
<p>Every action that is registered with <code>PLUMED_REGISTER_ACTION</code> should also be documented in a PLUMEDOC page.</p>
<p><em>action_without_examples</em></p>
<p>Every action that is registered should contain an <code>Example</code> section in its documentation. Notice that if the <code>Example</code> section is not added the manual will not show the registered keywords.</p>
<p><em>action_without_verbatim</em></p>
<p>Every action that is registered should contain an example in the form of a <code>plumedfile</code> section. This is currently a stylistic warning since there are many actions not satisfying this requirement.</p>
<p><em>unregistered_action</em></p>
<p>Every action that is documented should be also registered using <code>PLUMED_REGISTER_ACTION</code>.</p>
<p><em>undocumented_cltool</em></p>
<p>Every cltool that is registered with <code>PLUMED_REGISTER_CLTOOL</code> should also be documented in a PLUMEDOC page.</p>
<p><em>cltool_without_examples</em></p>
<p>Every cltool that is registered should contain an <code>Example</code> section in its documentation. Notice that if the <code>Example</code> section is not added the manual will not show the registered options.</p>
<p><em>cltool_without_verbatim</em></p>
<p>Every cltool that is registered should contain an example in the form of a <code>verbatim</code> section.</p>
<p><em>unregistered_cltool</em></p>
<p>Every cltool that is documented should be also registered using <code>PLUMED_REGISTER_CLTOOL</code>.</p>
<p><em>undefined_has</em></p>
<p>Every macro in the form <code>__PLUMED_HAS_SOMETHING</code> that is used in the code should be defined in configure.ac. This check is made to avoid errors with mis-typed macros.</p>
<p><em>unused_has</em></p>
<p>Every macro in the form <code>__PLUMED_HAS_SOMETHING</code> that is defined in configure.ac should be used at least once in the code. This check is made to avoid errors with mis-typed macros. </p>
